          <h4>About Me</h4>
          <p>I'm currently an RA at the New York Fed. I was previously an undergrad at Swarthmore College studying math and econ. I'm interested in computational methods and machine learning applications to economics. At the moment, my hobbies include backpacking and learning languages (am currently learning Mandarin and French).</p>

        <li><a href="" target="_blank">Estimating Intergenerational Effects of Early Age Human Capital Investment </a> (2025) Stephen O'Connell, Michael Vinh Pham. Working Paper.
        <li><p>Should public spending on early-age human capital formation be protected
          during a fiscal consolidation? The question is relevant to countries throughout the global
          income distribution. We address it using a DSGE with overlapping generations in which
          parental inputs are combined with public resources to produce skills that become
          productive when children reach adulthood. Private inputs are subject to a borrowing
          constraint, and potentially also to parental misperceptions of the human capital
          production function. We show how to calibrate a DSGE like ours to match these distortions
          in the data. We then use stochastic simulations to quantify the impact of reductions of
          public support to early-age human capital formation on lifetime income and wage
          inequality within the affected cohorts, and on the intergenerational transmission of
          inequality.

        <li><p>This paper evaluates how the construction of multi-family properties in Los Angeles affect the neighborhood characteristic nearby as defined as greenery coverage. I create address-level panel data by employing computer vision techniques applied to street-level imagery and use difference-in-differences estimators. I find that multi-family development has no negative effect on nearby tree and greenery coverage and may even contribute to a modest increase, with estimates indicating a statistically significant 2.3% rise in total greenery (trees and shrubs) coverage.
        <li><a href="files/seguro_august.pdf" target="_blank">How Universal Healthcare Affects Individuals’ Choices: The Case of Seguro Popular</a> (2024) Michael Vinh Pham. Working Paper. </b></li>
        <li><p>This paper assesses the effects of Seguro Popular, a universal healthcare program implemented in Mexico, on individuals' labor force participation, family planning, and the take-up of womens’ preventative cancer screenings. I exploit variation in roll-out of municipalities to find the intent-to-treatment effect and use a machine learning based method, Matrix Completion, to assess the robustness of these effects. I find that the implementation of Seguro Popular increases the target demographic for Mammogram take-up of such exams, has no significant effect on take-up of Papanicolaou Tests, and find some evidence to support the claim that Seguro Popular increased the amount of children women wanted to have. Finally, Seguro Popular had a negative effect on labor force participation, most notably among working males.

            <li><p>In this paper, we present a systematic literature review that explores the utilization of machine learning (ML) algorithms for analyzing datasets from Electroencephalography (EEG) based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). Our primary aim is to provide computer science students with a comprehensive and accessible overview of the role of machine learning in EEG analysis. By synthesizing and organizing recent research from 2020 onwards, our objective is to empower the target audience to develop a solid foundational understanding of the current state of ML-EEG research. Through this work, we intend to enhance the accessibility and comprehension of ML-EEG studies and contribute to advancing BCI technology.
